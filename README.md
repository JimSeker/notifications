Android Notification Examples
===========
eclipse/ has the examples for eclipse.  This is no longer updated.  otherwise the examples are of Andriod Studio.


<b>NotificationDemo</b> shows how many of the different notifications works with the support notification lib.
There is also have a Broadcast receiver, which NotificationDemo2 needs.  There is also example of how to set a notification for the "future" using an alarm manager.

<b>NotificationDemo2</b> uses notificationDemo with the alarammanager to setup a notification to be sent later on (via the broadcast receiver in notificationdemo)

<b>notificationDemo3</b> is an example of how setup remoteInput (ie replies on notifications).  Also how you aplications can know if the notifcations were read and deleted.  Some code is from https://github.com/googlesamples/android-MessagingService and https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ActiveNotifications/ 

<b>NotiODemo</b> is an API 26 only (android O, v8.0) demo to see the channel IDs and dots/badges.  Currently the dots are not showing, which is possibly: I need to be using studio 3.0 and/or the O preview 3 on a nexus 5x is not working correctly.  I'll test as then come out of preview to final versions (O and studio).

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
